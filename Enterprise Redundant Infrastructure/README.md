Objective: Showcase high availability and routing protocols.

Design: Two routers connected to two different ISP simulations.
Key Features:
Dynamic Routing: Configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) with multiple areas.
Redundancy: Implement HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) for gateway redundancy.
EtherChannel: Bundle multiple links between switches using LACP for increased bandwidth and failover.
