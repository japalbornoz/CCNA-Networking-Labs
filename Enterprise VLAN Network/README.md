Project 1: Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Office Network Objective: Showcase foundational routing, switching, and IP management.

Design: Use a 3-tier hierarchical model (Core, Distribution, Access). Key Features: VLAN Segmentation: Separate VLANs for Data, Voice, Management, and Guests. Inter-VLAN Routing: Use a "Router-on-a-Stick" or a Layer 3 Switch. DHCP Server: Configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server for all VLANs. Subnetting: Document your VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) plan to prove you don't waste IP addresses. Project 2: Enterprise Redundant Infrastructure Objective: Showcase high availability and routing protocols.

Design: Two routers connected to two different ISP simulations. Key Features: Dynamic Routing: Configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) with multiple areas. Redundancy: Implement HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) for gateway redundancy. EtherChannel: Bundle multiple links between switches using LACP for increased bandwidth and failover. Project 3: Network Security & Edge Hardening Objective: Showcase your CCST Cybersecurity knowledge.

Design: An edge router protecting an internal server farm. Key Features: Standard & Extended ACLs: Permit only specific traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) to the web server and block everything else. NAT/PAT: Configure Static NAT for the server and PAT for internal users. Port Security: Secure access switches to only allow specific MAC addresses, preventing unauthorized device plug-ins. SSH Management: Disable Telnet and enforce SSH with local AAA.
