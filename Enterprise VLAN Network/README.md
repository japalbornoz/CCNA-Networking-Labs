Project 1: Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Office Network 
Objective: Showcase foundational routing, switching, and IP management by designing, building, and troubleshooting VLANs using a router-on-a-stick and a multilayer switch, and demonstrate the use case of DTP and VTP.


Design: Use a 3-tier hierarchical model (Core, Distribution, Access). 
Key Features: VLAN Segmentation: Separate VLANs for Data, Voice, Management, and Guests. 
Inter-VLAN Routing: Use a "Router-on-a-Stick" or a Layer 3 Switch. 
DHCP Server: Configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server for all VLANs. 
Subnetting: Document the VLSM plan to conserve IP addresses. 


Build:
	3 switches (Core, Access1, Access2)
	1 router (Router-on-a-Stick)
	4–8 PCs
Configure:
	VLAN segmentation (HR, IT, Sales)
	Trunking
	Inter-VLAN routing
	DHCP per VLAN
	Port security
	Disable unused ports
Troubleshooting cases:
	  Break trunk → fix 
	  Wrong VLAN → diagnose
